The data from the spreadsheet was taken from results found on the World Athletics website: https://www.worldathletics.org/results/world-athletics-championships.  Data was copied and pasted into the spreadsheet roughly 6-8 entries at a time, and was given a label of either H, S, or F which stand for "Heats", "Semifinals", and "Finals", which are the three stages of competition for every World Championship from 2001-2022.  In 1999 there were four stages with a quartefinal round taking place in between Heats and the Semifinals.  The data was cleaned to remove any instances of DNS (Did not start).
