# Code README
- Models.Rmd was used in determining the best model and contains many of the models
tested but ultimately not used in the analysis. 
- GLMM.Rmd contains more models (some of which are found in Models.Rmd) and also 
contains the simulation code responsible for generating the results of the GLMM.
- RankComparison.Rmd is the code for the rank-based methods.  Included is the
code for the 2019 vs 2022 and 2022 national level vs 2022 international competition
comparisons.
- Plots.Rmd is the code used to generate the ggplot graphs generated throughout 
the paper.
- Women.Rmd is exploratory analysis based on the women's data
- Times.Rmd is old and was exploratory analysis but now largely defunct.
