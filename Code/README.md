+ ReactionBarrierAnalysis.Rmd contains the GAMLSS analysis with generalized
Gamma models.  Also included is the supplementary analysis.

+ RankComparison.Rmd contains code for the rank-based methods.  Included is the
code for the six analyses: 2019 vs 2022 for men and women, 2022 national vs
2022 international for men and women and 2022 vs 2023 for men and women.

+ gamlss.R contains exploration of several new types of models from
the generalized Gamma, log normal, gamma, weibull, and inverse gaussian families.

+ gg.R contains exploration of several types of generalized Gamma models, as
well as some miscellaneous/exploratory analysis.
