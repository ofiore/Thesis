# JY comments (remove after you are done)

+ If the Rmd files contains no text descriptions, why not just put them as a R
  script? The point of Rmd files is to make the descriptions to explain what you
  do.
  
+ Do not mention Archive if we are not submitting Archive.

+ Keep the source line width under 80; break the lines at appropriate places.
